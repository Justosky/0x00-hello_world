I will explain the function of each script in this directory
1. a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
2. a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
3. a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
     The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
4. a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
